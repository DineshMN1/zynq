Optimize ZynqCloud for UI responsiveness without reducing upload throughput.

Uploads must run in a dedicated high-performance pipeline that prioritizes maximum disk read, hashing, and network transmission speed. UI optimizations such as lazy rendering, virtualization, and worker scheduling must not throttle or delay the upload data flow.

The upload engine should:

• Stream chunks continuously without artificial pauses
• Use parallel hashing where possible
• Saturate available network bandwidth
• Decouple upload logic from UI rendering cycles
• Send lightweight progress updates only
• Maintain UI smoothness without limiting throughput

Performance safeguards must protect the interface — not slow down the upload pipeline.

The goal is to achieve full-speed file transfer while keeping the UI responsive, even on lower-end systems.
